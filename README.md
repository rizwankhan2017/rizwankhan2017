## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ This is Rizwan Khan

Currently, I work for Emirates Airlines as a check-in agent. My experience at Emirates has helped me develop my communication and time management skills. I am also currently a TripleTen student, working to break into the tech industry. The material at TripleTen covers a variety of skills, such as Excel, SQL, Tableau, and Power BI, and includes numerous hands-on projects.
Some Facts about me
* I love playing sports, hiking, and calisthenics
* One of my favorite things to do on a day off is walk around nyc and find a new place to eat.
* Goal in 2025 is to land a job in tech and to learn how to do a handstand
